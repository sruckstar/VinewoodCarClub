Now you can visit the Vinewood Car Club in story mode of GTA 5 on PC. The garage offers 10 vehicles that you can acquire free of charge.

The mod synchronises with the open repository on GitHub, meaning that the cars in the garage will change every month, in line with changes to GTA Online. You can also disable online synchronization and change vehicles at will in the VehicleList.txt file.

To ensure the mod works properly, you need to install Enhanced Content for Legacy. Without this patch, you will not be able to see the Vinewood Club logo, and online synchronisation may not work correctly.

This mod is compatible with the Vinewood Club Garage by HKH191. I recommend installing that too.

MOD DOES NOT WORK ON ENHANCED VERSION OF GTA 5!
